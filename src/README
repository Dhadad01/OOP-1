Player Approaches:
a. clever Approach:
- Aims to populate the initial column from top to bottom.
- In case all cells are occupied
- the approach shifts to selecting a random available cell on the board.

b. genius Approach:
- The primary objective of this approach is to 
  obstruct the IngeniousPlayer by initiating from the second row.
- Chooses a cell in each column, effectively disrupting the attempts 
  of the IngeniousPlayer to fill the first column.
- If all cells are filled, the approach resorts to choosing a random available cell on the board.

Benefits:
- Abstraction: The structure facilitates the seamless inclusion of 
  different players in the future without altering the existing classes.
- Information Concealment: The implementation conceals the specifics of 
  each player's approach, ensuring a neat and modular design.
- Polymorphism: The strategy pattern allows for the interchangeable use of 
  different player approaches,fostering code flexibility and maintainability.
